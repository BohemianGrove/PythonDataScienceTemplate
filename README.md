# PythonDataScienceTemplate
A template for a non programmer analyst looking to learn how to parse and make CSV Files. This is done by using python reflection capabilities and creating self modifying readers, writers, and printers that update dynamically with whatever changes to the structure required. This makes it easy for someone to hop in with little or no coding experience and get immediate results that can be useful immediately to their day job.
